Hey there! I’m glad you found your way here.

This blog is my little corner of the internet where I share thoughts, experiments, and tips on topics I care about — mostly coding, tools I use, debugging tricks, and whatever I’m learning or building.

If you're into:

- 🧑‍💻 Programming & automation  
- 🧪 Debugging real-world systems  
- 🛠️ Building reliable software  
- 📚 Learning new tech, workflows, and ideas  

…then you’ll probably feel right at home.

Thanks for stopping by!
