## 1. What Your Agent Needs to Do

Your agent has to:

- **Understand requests in natural language** (e.g., “Book a DJ for Saturday”).
    
- **Break them down into tasks** (reservations, shopping lists, invitations, etc.).
    
- **Take action** (call APIs, update your database, send notifications).
    

That means it’s more than just a chatbot — it’s a **task-oriented AI agent**.

## 2. Models You Could Use

You don’t need to train a big LLM from scratch (too expensive). Instead, you’ll use **existing LLMs** and fine-tune or ground them in your app’s data.

### Options:

1. **OpenAI GPT models** (e.g., GPT-4o-mini, GPT-5 once stable)
    
    - Great at reasoning + can call your backend APIs.
        
    - Supports structured outputs (JSON → easy for DRF integration).
        
2. **Anthropic Claude** or **Mistral/Mixtral** (open source)
    
    - Claude is good for reasoning.
        
    - Mistral/Mixtral is free/self-hostable (good if you want privacy).
        
3. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
    
    - If you want your agent to pull info from your database (events, past shopping lists, favorite venues, etc.), you’ll need **embeddings + vector database** (like PostgreSQL `pgvector`, Weaviate, or Pinecone).

## 3. How You Train It

- **Base LLM**: You don’t train it from scratch.
    
- **Fine-tune or prompt engineering**:
    
    - Use **system prompts** to guide behavior (e.g., “You are an event planner AI. You help users plan events by suggesting shopping lists, hiring workers, etc.”).
        
    - Optionally fine-tune on **your domain data** (past events, common shopping lists, example reservations).
        

### Example fine-tune dataset:

```json
[   
	{"messages": [
		{"role": "user", "content": "I want to host a birthday party for 10 kids"}, 
		{"role": "assistant", "content": "You’ll need snacks, a cake, balloons, and games. Here’s a shopping list: ..."}
		]},   
	{"messages": [ 
		{"role": "user", "content": "Can you book a catering service for Saturday at 7pm?"},     
		{"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure, here are 3 caterers available near you: ..."}   ]
		} 
]
```

## 4. How to Integrate With Django REST Framework

You want your AI to **call your backend APIs** when it needs to do something (not just talk). That means you’ll use a **tools/agents approach**.

### Architecture:

- **Django REST API** (your system for events, locations, users, shopping lists, etc.).
    
- **AI Agent layer** (calls the model and interprets requests).
    
- **Function calling / tool use** (the LLM calls your APIs).
    

### Example Flow:

1. User: “Plan a baby shower for 20 guests”
    
2. Agent:
    
    - Calls `POST /events/` to create the event.
        
    - Calls `POST /shopping-list/` to create shopping items.
        
    - Calls `POST /invitations/` to generate invitations.
        
3. Agent replies to the user: “I created your event, added a shopping list, and drafted invitations.”
