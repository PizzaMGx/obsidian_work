**I. Project Structure & Services:**

* **Django/DRF Backend:** This service handles the core business logic, data models, and REST API.  It interacts with the PostgreSQL database and MinIO for file storage.  It also interacts with Elasticsearch for updating user statistics.

* **Angular Frontend:**  A single-page application (SPA) providing the primary user interface for interacting with the backend API.

* **Angular Agent Frontend:** A separate SPA for agents, potentially with different permissions and functionalities compared to the main frontend.

* **PostgreSQL Database:**  Persists application data (accounts, transactions, customers, etc.).

* **MinIO:** Object storage for handling files (e.g., documents related to accounts or loans).

* **Elasticsearch:**  A NoSQL database used for indexing and searching user statistics and potentially other analytical data.

* **Kibana:**  Provides a visualization dashboard for exploring the data stored in Elasticsearch.


**II. Docker Setup & Kubernetes Deployment:**

Each service will run in its own Docker container, managed by Kubernetes.  You'll need separate Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) for each service, defining:

* **Deployments:**  Specify the number of replicas (pods) for each service, resource requests and limits, and container images.

* **Services:**  Expose the services to the cluster and potentially externally using LoadBalancers or Ingress controllers.

* **Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs):** For PostgreSQL and MinIO, to ensure data persistence across pod restarts and scaling.  Consider using a cloud-provider's managed persistent storage.

* **ConfigMaps/Secrets:** Store sensitive information like database passwords, API keys, and MinIO access credentials separately from your code, using Kubernetes secrets.

* **Ingress:**  Manage external access to your services (Frontend, Agent Frontend, API).

* **StatefulSets (for PostgreSQL):**  Maintain persistent storage and unique identities for each PostgreSQL pod, crucial for database consistency.

* **Helm Charts (Recommended):**  Packaging and deploying Kubernetes manifests can become complex.  Using Helm charts significantly simplifies this process. You would define each service as a separate chart, and then assemble them into a single application chart.

**III. Technology Stack (Updated):**

* **Backend:** Python (Django, Django REST framework)
* **Frontend:** Angular (two separate apps)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch
* **Object Storage:** MinIO
* **Containerization:** Docker
* **Orchestration:** Kubernetes
* **CI/CD:**  A CI/CD pipeline (Jenkins, GitLab CI, etc.) is essential for automating deployments.
