A recursive function is a function that calls itself, simple as that, but doing so infinitely will cause a stack overflow error unless you define a base case, dream inside a dream like shrek 3, is a simple but not optimal way to solve a problem and should only be used as last resource 
Steps to help solve it:
	- What's the simplest possible output
	- Play around with examples and visualize
	- Relate Harder Cases to simple cases
	- Generalize the pattern
	- Write code by combining recursive pattern with base cases
