## ðŸ“ˆ Suggested Roadmap

Hereâ€™s how you can pace this over the next 12â€“18 months:

### **Now (0â€“3 months)**:

- Pick **one data cert** (GCP or AWS Data Engineering)
    
- Build a portfolio project: backend API â†’ ETL â†’ analytics dashboard (Streamlit, Metabase, Superset)
    
- Document it on a blog or GitHub
    

### **Mid-Term (4â€“9 months)**:
\
- Take **CKA or AWS Architect** if you want backend leadership credibility
    
- Learn Spark or Airflow if youâ€™re serious about data pipelines
    
- Start playing with security labs like TryHackMe (even 1 hour/week)
    

### **Longer-Term (9â€“18 months)**:

- Consider **OSCP** if you love security (or stick with eJPT + blogs for now)
    
- Lead a small team or mentor a junior
    
- Look for **tech lead** opportunities, either formally or within side projects
